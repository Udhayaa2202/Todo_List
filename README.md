# Todo_List
This is my first ReactJs Application. Have learn many basics in this module.
Here I created a components folder within that components folder there will be a assets and Css folder.
Using .jsx i used to write the code with html and used .css to design the .jsx file.

HOW IT WORKS:

  Once you have deployed you can able to lookup the local storage which is available through inspecting the page. In that click Application on the left side there will be local storage click on that, After clicking that the drop down icon will display the local host port like "http://localhost:5174/". In that there are key and value through that we can able to see the total number of todos count and todos. In local stoarage you can able to see the live performance of the tasks.

  If you add a new task it will be stored in the local storage and if you reload the task you provided didn't deleted from the lsited tasks. Once you have completed the task you will click the circle icom that will appear with tick icon inside the circle and also the task you provided will be striked through once you have clicked the circle icon. 
  So if you don't need that task you can able to delete the task. There will be a cross icon will be appeared on right side once you have added the task. Click the cross icon then it will be deleted from the todo lists.
